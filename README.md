<!--* CREATE THE INDEX PAGE WITH IMAGES AND LINKS -->

Decided to go with an SVG file for the index page.
This was the first time using this file type.
Not sure it is a good option, may change to a PNG or JPG.

<!--* CSS -->

Decide to add a link to a stylesheet even though the
Odin Project does not require it at this time. Hoping that
the course does not go in that direction for this project
or I will have to redo all CSS to continue.

<!--* DIRECTORY TREE -->

Create directories for images, css, and recipes.

Create first recipe page and will use that for
the other recipe pages like a template

<!--* ADD CONTENT TO PAGES -->

Add all the content to the recipes; ingredients and directions.

Created a "Back to top" button with a link to a div that is absolute
positioned at the top of the page and set to hidden.

<!--* FINAL? -->

Is anything in Web Design ever really final?

Once finished, made a last git commit and push to GitHub.

Not 100% satisfied with the site. Would make some changes, like
placing the nav at the top and position it with either sticky or
fixed, which would allow the removal of "Back to Top" buttons.

Some sidebars and styling changes would make the site look better.

I am very satisfied with the outcome for such a simple site and
look forward to moving forward in the Odin-Project course.
